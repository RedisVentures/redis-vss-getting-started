        "Today, about 80% of the data organizations generate is \"unstructured\"; data that either does not have a well-defined schema or cannot be restructured into a familiar columnar format. Typical examples of unstructured data include free-form text, images, videos, and sound clips. Moreover, this data imbalance towards unstructured data is expected to grow in the coming decades.\n",
        "\n",

        "Traditionally, unstructured data is processed to extract specific features, effectively turning it into structured data. Once in the realm of structured data, we can search the data with SQL queries (if stored in a relational database) or with a text search engine. \n",
        "The approach of transforming unstructured data into structured data has a few issues; first, engineering features out of unstructured data can be computationally expensive and error-prone, significantly delaying when we can effectively use the data. And secondly, in the extractions/transformation process, lose fidelity and information since unique, 'latent' features are likely lost or overlooked because they can't be easily categorized or quantified."

By \"vectorizing,\" we mean to somehow convert something like a text passage, an image, a video, or a song into a flat sequence of numbers representing a particular piece of data. These \"vectors\" are representations of the data in N-dimensional space. By vectorizing, we gain the ability to use linear algebra techniques to compare, group, and operate on our data. This is the foundation of a Vector Database; the ability to store and operate on vectors.\n",

Such Simple modifications could effectively sidestep techniques like Bag-of-Words, preventing systems using the generated encodings from identifying texts with similar meanings.\n",

The Jigger\\u2019s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks.

This is referred to as \"Asymmetric Semantic Search,\" often employed in cases where the search query and the documents being searched are of different nature or structure. Suitable models for asymmetric semantic search include pre-trained [MS MARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) Models. MS MARCO models are trained on the **M**icro**S**oft **MA**chine **R**eading **CO**mprehension dataset, and are optimized for understanding real-world queries and retrieving relevant responses.

Fat Kenda Booster tires give you grip in corners and on wet trails. The Shimano Tourney drivetrain offered enough gears for finding a comfortable pace to ride uphill, and the Tektro hydraulic disc brakes break smoothly. Whether you want an affordable bike that you can take to work, but also take trail riding on the weekends or you\\u2019re just after a stable, comfortable ride for the bike path, the Summit gives a good value for money.\",\n",
